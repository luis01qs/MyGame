This is a self-played game. It uses genetic algorithms to be solved. It has no name as it has no player.

Description of the game: It consists on a room with five different obstacles. And there are several posible obstacles:
-  A vertical static wall at the center (in the Y-coordinate) of the room.
-  A pair of two vertical static walls at the bottom and the top of the room.
-  A horizontal wall in the middle (in the Y-coordinate) of the room.
-  A pair of two rotating walls, one on top of each other.
-  A single vertical wall moving upwards and downwards.

The main characters in the game are a set of 100 particles per generation. Each particle is represented with a triangular form. The movement of the particles has a constant speed, and the spike is always pointing to the direction of the movement. Since the speed is constant, the only thing variable in each frame is the velocity vector, which point in a certain angule and has the same speed.
